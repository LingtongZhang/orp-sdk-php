Open Recommendation Platform - SDK v0.3
=======================================

The Open Recommendation Platform (ORP) is a distributed platform of entities capable of delivering recommendations for various purposes. It consists of recommendation providers and recommendation consumers that interact and communicate over a standardized protocol. This document describes the protocol and outlines the necessary steps a partner needs to take in order to integrate a technology as recommendation provider. The overall aim of the ORP is to obtain a better recommendation quality. In the context of advertising, better recommendations are defined by a higher CPM (cost per impression). In the context of on-site recommendations, better recommendations are defined by a higher CTR (click-through-rate). You will learn about these contexts in a later chapter. The chapter Push interface describes the API that recommendation providers need to implement.

Technical restrictions
-----------------------

Please ensure your system is able to reply within 100ms, as response time is critical for our application. Please further ensure that your system can handle the amount of incoming data. Expect up to several thousand requests per second. When we detect a performance problem, we may automatically decrease the amount of requests forwarded to your system.


State of development
---------------------
The ORP and this protocol are actively being developed, so expect major changes of the API over time. This document is also still in an incomplete state. We will regularly publish updates.
